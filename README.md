## PHP Cats App:
Developed during spring/summer of 2022 and completed in Jan 2023.
### Technologies used:
PHP    
mySQL/PDO    
HTML/CSS/JavaScript    
Bootstrap 5  

## Design Notes
Originally a simple PHP App.  I have added some JavaScript to give a better user experience. JavaScript is mainly used for messaging.  

## Development and Testing
Developed on xampp and heroku.
Tested on Chrome developer tools.

## File Structure
The main pages for the app are in the root directory.
There is also another directory for include files which contain common code like header and footer and also make the app more manageable by keeping file sizes down.
The database folder contains PHP classes relating to database access. 
For most pages there is a css and JavaScript file which can be found in the css and js folders with the same name as the PHP file.
